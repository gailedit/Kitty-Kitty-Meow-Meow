## **Technical Requirements**

Your app must:

- **HAVE ITS OWN REPO, under your github account. NOT A FORK.**
- **Git 20+ commits** Commit early, commit often. Tell a story with your commits. Each message should give a clear idea what you changed.
- **Include Wireframes and User Stories in the README**
- **Wireframe:** - Basically draw out what your game will look like—very different way it could look. You can use paper or any wireframe tool you find online.
- **User Stories** - Wording should center around how a user interacts with your game, for example:
    1. The user click starts and the level starts
    2. When the user hits the `f key` a fire ball is catuplulated at a target.
- **Render a game in the browser**
- **Include separate HTML / CSS / JavaScript files**
- Stick with **KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid)** and **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)** principles
- Use **JavaScript or jQuery** for **DOM manipulation**
- **Deploy your game online**, where the rest of the world can access it (we will show you how)
- Use **semantic markup** for HTML and CSS (adhere to best practices)
- Be reasonably complex

## **Necessary Deliverables**

- A working MVP (minium viable product) what is the absolute bare minimum functionality for you game, do not make it more complex until you've completed your MVP.
- A **working game, built by you**, hosted somewhere on the internet
- A **link to your hosted working game** in the URL section of your Github repo
- A **git repository hosted on Github**, with a link to your hosted game, and frequent commits dating back to the very beginning of the project.
- **A `README.md` file** with an explanation of what the project is and why you made it, your user stories, explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, installation instructions, unsolved problems, the other components previously indicated (if applicable). In this project, also include your wireframes in the readme.
- A 10 minute presentation to your classmates and instructor, illustrating:
    - App functionality
    - Triumphs
    - Challenges
    - Words of Wisdom
    - Code snippets
